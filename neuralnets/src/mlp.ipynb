    "# Scikit-Learn vs PyTorch, Keras, and TensorFlow #\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's topic is to learn how to use the PyTorch, Keras, and TensorFlow frameworks. These three machine learning packages are built specifically for neural networks and deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scikit-Learn ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Our old ML framework, Scikit-Learn, is great for classical ML algorithms and building shallow networks. However, it has significant limitations for modern neural networks such as CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers. And there is no support for GPU acceleration (contrary to what I said in class) *unless* you install NVIDIA's RAPIDS cuML package `import cuml` or Intel's OneAPI package `import sklearnex`. Each of these packages is linked directly to your graphics card, so the cuML module won't help if you have an Intel GPU and vice-versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PyTorch, Keras, and TensorFlow ###\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, these new frameworks are built for deep learning. PyTorch was originally created as an open-source project by Meta (Facebook) but at this point the development is mostly driven by the larger ML/AI community. TensorFlow is an open-source Google product. Although anyone can theoretically contribute to it, the project is largely under control of Google AI and it has built-in support for processing on Google Cloud AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "All three deep-learning frameworks provide native GPU acceleration. PyTorch requires the user to manually enable the GPU whereas the other two frameworks offload large computations to the GPU automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras used to be its own independent, high-level deep-learning package. It could run on top of a handful of various low-level packages, but the most common was Google's TensorFlow. In 2019, Google integrated Keras into TensorFlow. If you want create models at a high-level, taking the default architectures, then you use Keras `from tensorflow import keras`. But if you want low-level customization, then you can use TensorFlow on its own."

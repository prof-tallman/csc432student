    "\n",
    "We can use clustering as a means to compress images. But it's going to work a little differently than what you are used to: Instead of guessing at the number of clusters, we purposely choose the k-value depending on how much compression we desire. The lower the k-value, the higher the compression but the more distorted the picture. The higher the k-value, the lower the compression but the picture will look closer to the original. We'll be using k-values of 256. I chose this number because we can represent 256 clusters with 8 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The clustering algorithm will give us a palette of RGB colors that \"represent\" the overall image. So for the 256 cluster algorithm, we'll have 256 colors in our palette. These palette colors are actually the centroids from the algorithm. Once K-means chooses the color palette for us, we'll replace the original pixels with these representative values (e.g., the identity of their cluster).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll go ahead and use the SKLearn version of K-means as our clustering algorithm. If you'd like to substitute your own version of K-means, that's OK too although it might be slower."

INTERNSHIP CHECKLIST
Concordia University Irvine
Computer Science

Congratulations on finding an internship within the field of computer science! We trust this will
be a rewarding experience that builds on the foundation of your course work and propels you
from academics to the professional world.

Steps 1: Find the Position

Your internship must involve work at a company within the field of computer science. The
company does not need to be known as a computer company, but your job needs to be within a
computer science role. You could work at Target if they had you writing or analyzing software.
There are three steps to finding this job: First, an organization needs to hire you. Second, the
CUI Computer Science Program needs to approve the job. And lastly, you need to submit the
CUI university-wide internship application (which is something of a formality).

1. Get hired for a computer science position (resume, interview, etc.)
2. Submit the Computer Science Program’s Internship Proposal Form
3. Complete the Registrar’s Registration for Internship Form

There is a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem going on here: how do you gain CUI approval for a
job that you don’t yet have… how do you apply for a job if you haven’t gained CUI approval?
We suggest that you discuss any potential jobs with the computer science faculty before going
to all of the trouble of applying. After you have been hired, then you can take the time to
submit the formal paperwork.

Once your formal paperwork is submitted, it must be approved by the Computer Science
department faculty. Faculty will verify that your position meets all requirements. Internships
may be denied for reasons including:
● Insufficient time – you need to work at least 135 documented hours
● Poor support structure – the organization must be able to help you succeed as an intern
● Inadequate rigor – the job must challenge and grow your computer science abilities
● Unethical duties – although it is rare, there are computer science jobs that are at odds
with Concordia University’s commitment to the Great Commission of Jesus Christ.

NOTE – if your application is denied but you would still like to accept the job, you may do so, but
it will not count towards CSC 490 credit.

Step 2: Complete Internship

After you have been hired and your internship has been approved, it is time to work the job!
You will use your hard-earned skills to create or maintain a product that real people really use!
Every internship is different, but many provide a decent salary and really help with your job
search after graduation. Some students learn, "Yes, I really want to return to that company"
whereas others find out that working for a particular company is different than they expected.
Here are some hints for a successful internship. These are not new suggestions; you know them
already. But we want to emphasize a few that you might take for granted:

● Be on time
● Be reliable
● Be friendly
● Be honest
● Keep a written "to do" list
● Get to know your coworkers
● Don't be afraid to ask for help
● Communicate well

As an intern, you are a representative of Concordia University Irvine and the Computer Science
department. Please demonstrate an attitude and behavior that reflects the appropriate positive
attributes you have learned at CUI. This will help you, the university, and future students.
As you are working, keep in mind the paperwork that you will need to be submitting when your
internship finishes. You will need a review from your supervisor and documentation showing
the number of your hours worked (a timesheet or paystub will be sufficient, or else a form
signed by your supervisor). Lastly, you will need to submit a short internship report that explains
what you accomplished and what the organization was like. We will use this report to help other
students find rewarding internship opportunities.

Step 3: Complete the Paperwork
You just completed your first job as a computer scientist—well done! Now it is time to get some credit
towards your degree. You must complete three forms:

1. Time Validation: Submit your timesheets showing at least 135 hours of work or else fill out the
Internship Time Log and have your supervisor sign it. You must show at least 135 hours of
documented work to pass the course.
2. Supervisor Evaluation: Your supervisor must complete an evaluation of your work. This
evaluation will form 30% of your grade.
3. Internship Report: Complete an internship report that helps future students decide whether they
want to apply for an internship at your organization. This report will count towards the
remaining 70% of your grade.

That's it—We hope that you have a great internship experience!
